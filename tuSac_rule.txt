Priority:
 1) Win
 2) pairs
 3) khui can not be 'dropped', even with win.  In the same token, khap (3 cards) can not be broken.
 4) no addition trash: a play can not be done and increase trash in hand: pair can not be broken and play as trash. 
    x p p m, can not  use p p as a pair, since that would result in 1 additional trash.
